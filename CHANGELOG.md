Removed dependency of `vue-gtag`

Bugfix: 
* this.$gtag() works not correctly in components

Improved:
* new options `disableAutoPageTrack`
* Debug improved to track all `$gtag()` calls and prints out the arguments
* added test for event tracking

Breaking Change:

* `options` renamed to `config`
```js
// nuxt.config.js
'google-gtag':{
 id:'ID_XX_XX',
 config: {
   // your gtag options
 }
}
```
